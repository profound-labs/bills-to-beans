** Overview

This is a helper tool for [[http://furius.ca/beancount/][beancount]] and [[https://aumayr.github.io/fava/][fava]] to practise [[http://plaintextaccounting.org/][plaintextaccounting]].

It saves transactions as `.beancount` text and keeps bill documents in a regular
folder structure.

You should type as little as possible but get reports and understand your
finances with charts.

The `bills-to-beans` program is a self-contained executable file. It doesn't
install anything. Download, copy to your bills folder and run it.

Windows and Linux.

*** Workflow

- Scan bills, receipts and payments as they come in
- Add new bills in the browser
  - uploaded documents are saved in a folder
  - a `.beancount` plain text file describes the transaction
- Open `fava` in the browser to navigate and query your accounts
- Sync it with others via Dropbox
- Share the documents with your accountant

** Folder Structure

Documents and `.beancount` files are saved in a folder structure of this
pattern:

: year/month/date _ payee _ description _ amount/

Such as:

: 2016/
:   01/
:   02/
:     2016-02-12 _ IKEA _ cupboard _ $55.95/
:       receipt.pdf
:       bill.beancount
:     ...
:   03/
:     2016-03-25 _ CarTek _ car service _ $250.20/
:       receipt.pdf
:       bill.beancount
:     ...

** Setup
*** Folders

The following is an example. You can set it up differently, just put
`config.yml` in the same folder as the `bills-to-beans` executable, and declare
the folder paths in it.

: Bills/
: |  ledger.beancount        ; Main beancount file with account names
: |  b2b-new-bills.bat       ; Starts the web interface
: |  b2b-watch.bat           ; Watches the Receipts... folder for changes
: |  fava-drophere.bat       ; Drag-and-drop the main beancount file to start fava
: |
: |- Receipts and Payments/  ; For the bill documents per year and month
: |
: |- tools/                  ; Program and config files
: |    bills-to-beans_win.exe
: |    bills-to-beans_linux
: |    config.yml
: |
: |--  tmp/
: |      includes.beancount  ; This file is created by bills-to-beans
: |

Examples:

=config.yml=

: bills_folder: ../Receipts And Payments
: main_beancount_file: ../ledger.beancount
: includes_beancount_file: ./tmp/includes.beancount
: server_port: 3030

=b2b-new-bills.bat=

: cd tools
: bills-to-beans_win.exe

=b2b-watch.bat=

: cd tools
: bills-to-beans_win.exe watch

=fava-drophere.bat=

: start %USERPROFILE%\.babun\cygwin\bin\mintty.exe -e /bin/bash -l -c 'fava "$(cygpath %1)"'
: start "" "http://localhost:5000"

*** Beancount files

TODO

- ledger.beancount
  - should have and include directive to the tmp include

- includes.beancount

*** Fava on Windows with Cygwin
**** Babun Cygwin shell

Go to [[http://babun.github.io/][babun]] and download the installer. Extract the archive (such as =babun-1.2.0-dist.zip=) and run =install.bat= as a regular user (not as Administrator).

After the setup completes, the shell will display the greeting message and a prompt. This is where you type in commands.

: { ~ }  Â»

Babun installs all its files at =C:\Users\USERNAME\.babun=.

Close the shell window, open the =.babun= folder in Windows File Explorer and run =rebase.bat=.

Later on if you see [[https://github.com/babun/babun/issues/477][fork::abort]] errors when running a command, close all shells, run =rebase.bat= and try again.

**** Python3 tools

Open the babun shell and type or copy the following commands one-by-one.

: pact install python3
: pact install python3-lxml
: pact install python3-setuptools
: easy_install-3.4 pip
: pip install wheel

**** Fava

: pip install beancount-fava

Now run:

: fava

It should print the usage text.

If you have a newer version of =fava= as a =.whl= file, =cd= to the folder in the shell and install it with:

: pip install beancount_fava-[...].whl

Remember that the =Tab= key will auto-complete the filename after typing the first few letters.

If the =.whl= is in =Downloads= or some other place, you can also open the folder in Windows File Explorer, right click to open the context menu and select =Open Babun here=. Use =ls= to see the files and =cd foldername= to change folders.

*** Fava on Linux

: pip3 install beancount-fava

*** Working with Dropbox
**** Don't sync the tmp folder

Open =Preferences... > Account > Selective Sync= and uncheck the =tmp= folder where bills-to-beans writes the =includes.beancount= file.

Press =[Update]=, Dropbox will display a message:

: Unchecked folders will be removed from the Computer's Dropbox.

Press =[OK]=

If the =tmp= folder was already present, at this point Dropbox will have probably removed it. Create it again as a New Folder, and Dropbox will ignore it from now on.

** Adding new bills
*** Uploading documents

Documents can be anything that is related to the transaction and is not a `.beancount`:

-  a PDF with images of bills
-  a PDF of an email
-  images from scanning

If the filename of the uploaded document has a recognizable information, it will
be automatically filled in:

- a date at the beginning of the filename (=YYYYMMDD= or =YYYY-MM-DD=)
- a numerical amount at the end
- the middle part will be the description

If a data field is already filled in, it will not be automatically overwritten.

** Renaming accounts in every beancount file

TODO

** Compile a Fava wheel file from Github

: git clone https://github.com/aumayr/fava.git
: cd fava

: virtualenv -p python3 venv
: . venv/bin/activate
: make build-js
: pip3 install --editable .
: python setup.py bdist_wheel

See the =.whl= in =dist/=

Install it:

: pip3 install beancount_fava-[...].whl
